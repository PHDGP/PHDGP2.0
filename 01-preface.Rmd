# Preface {#preface}

In June 2004, faculty at the Harvard School of Public Health implemented a training on Geocoding and Public Health Disparities with the aim of boosting efforts to address socioeconomic inequalities in health. This training offered a solution to the problem of lack of socioeconomic data in US public health surveillance systems. This solution is the geocoding of public health surveillance data and using census-derived area-based socioeconomic measures (ABSMs) to characterize both the cases and population in the catchment area, thereby enabling computation of rates stratified by the area-based measure of socioeconomic position.

Since 2004, both the theories around public health disparities and the analytic tools to measure them have evolved.

While the following materials will teach you about analyzing health data, we
must underscore that a health equity lens will be emphasized throughout these
materials. This book is written with as much emphasis on monitoring health for
accountability as they are for etiological studies.
