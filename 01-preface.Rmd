# Preface {#preface}

In June 2004, faculty at the Harvard School of Public Health implemented a training on Geocoding and Public Health Disparities with the aim of boosting efforts to address socioeconomic inequalities in health. This training offered a solution to the problem of lack of socioeconomic data in US public health surveillance systems. This solution is the geocoding of public health surveillance data and using census-derived area-based socioeconomic measures (ABSMs) to characterize both the cases and population in the catchment area, thereby enabling computation of rates stratified by the area-based measure of socioeconomic position.

Since 2004, both the theories around public health disparities and the analytic tools to measure them have evolved. The updated 2022 training, held in June and July, builds on prior work in geocoding health disparities expands on why & how to analyze population health and health inequities in relation to census tract, county, and other georeferenced societal and environmental data.

This online textbook, a companion to the virtual training, also serves as a standalone guide to help users explore the following topics at their own pace:

  - the history and context of, and rationale for, conducting this type of work
  - getting data from the Census and other sources 
  - visualizing geocoded data and social metrics 
  - conducting analyses with data aggregated to a specified level of geography vs. multi-level analyses with 2 or more levels of geography
  - interpreting data through a health equity lens
  
The texbook also offers three case examples that go through analysis of mortality data (including aggregation and spatial analysis), and two case examples to illustrate the use of aggregated data from the American Community Survey (ACS) and the CDC's PLACES dataset.

While the following materials will teach you about analyzing health data, we
must underscore that a health equity lens will be emphasized throughout these
materials. This book is written with as much emphasis on monitoring health for
accountability as they are for etiological studies.
