# Preface {#preface .unnumbered}

In June 2004, a team based at the Harvard School of Public Health
published a [monograph](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/thegeocodingproject/public-health-disparities-geocoding-project-monograph-june-2004/) (Krieger et al, 2004) based on the research and trainings we
created for our *Public Health Disparities Geocoding Project* (Krieger et al, 2004).
This project built on and systematized approaches the team members had
been developing, since the early 1990s, for using geocoding and
area-based socioeconomic measures to overcome the absence of
socioeconomic data in most US health records (Krieger, 1992; Krieger, 1998, Krieger et al, 2004).

The objective was to boost efforts to document and inform efforts to
address socioeconomic inequities in health, overall and in relation to
US racialized health inequities.

Oriented to academic researchers, health department staff, cancer
registries, and public health students, this training offered a solution
to the problem of lack of socioeconomic data in US public health
surveillance systems: the geocoding of public health surveillance data
and using census-derived area-based socioeconomic measures (ABSMs) to
characterize both the cases and populations in the catchment area,
thereby enabling computation of rates stratified by the area-based
measure of socioeconomic position. In addition to informing the analyses
of numerous scientific investigations, the work of the Public Health
Disparities Geocoding Project was adopted by numerous US state and local
health departments and cancer registries, and also informed the
decisions of the US National Cancer Institute's cancer registry system
to geocode their data to the census tract level and enable researchers
to access not only county-level ABSMs (public access data) but also
census tract level ABSMs (restricted data).

Since 2004, there has been a huge increase in conceptual and
methodological work regarding use of ABSMs to document and analyze
