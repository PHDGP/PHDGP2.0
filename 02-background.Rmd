# Background and History of Analytic Methods {#background}

*By: Nancy Krieger PhD, Dena Javadi*

In 2004, a team based at the Harvard T.H Chan School of Public Health's
Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences published a [[Project
Monograph]{.underline}](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/thegeocodingproject/public-health-disparities-geocoding-project-monograph-june-2004/)
describing the
[[motivation]{.underline}](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/thegeocodingproject/introduction/)
behind the *Public Health Disparities Geocoding Project* and its
analytic approaches, both conceptually and methodologically. The
monograph dove into methods of
[[geocoding]{.underline}](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/thegeocodingproject/geocoding/),
generating [[area-based social metrics
(ABSMs)]{.underline}](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/thegeocodingproject/generating-absms/),
[[Multi-level
Modeling]{.underline}](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/thegeocodingproject/multi-level-modeling/),
[[data
visualization]{.underline}](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/thegeocodingproject/visual-display/),
and [[basic epidemiologic methods for generating descriptive
statistics]{.underline}](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/thegeocodingproject/analytic-methods/),
with the intent of providing population health scientists, health
department staff, cancer registries, policy makers, and advocates and
activists for health justice with tools to put on the map -- literally
-- rampant but underreported socioeconomic inequities in health and
their links to racialized and spatial health inequities (Krieger et al, 2005; Krieger, 2009).

Key publications on these topics can also be found on the project's
[[publications
page]{.underline}](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/thegeocodingproject/publications/).

The *Public Health Disparities Geocoding Project* is informed by the
ecosocial theory of disease distribution, developed by Dr. Nancy Krieger
in
[[1994]{.underline}](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/027795369490202X?casa_token=_9JKsxrdf5gAAAAA:5s38ClF44ISx9OGzrDq-8DqY4b3iFHHY5WYQnBChxAO8pd5IVbPTgWOIWwsVGCcCCLDud_zskzk),
specifically "its focus on how people literally biologically embody
their societal and ecological context at multiple levels, across the
life course and historical generations" (Krieger, 2012).

Administrative health data, disease surveillance systems, and routine
health surveys are important tools in understanding disease distribution
and informing public health programming, advocacy, and policy
development. However, the social patterning of disease distribution is
often obscured by a lack of robust social metrics, including
socioeconomic data, pertinent to understanding health inequities -
defined as unfair, avoidable, and preventable health differences across
social groups (Krieger, 2011). These social groups, co-defined by social
relationships involving power, are among the many groups which together
comprise the "populations" that embody health, experience health
injustice (or health justice), and are the focus of public health
monitoring, research, and action. As defined by Krieger (2012),
"populations are dynamic beings constituted by intrinsic relationships
both among their members and with the other populations that together
produce their existence." Addressing health inequities across social
groups and within populations accordingly requires data on the
population-defined and defining relationships and characteristics that
create and are created by structures and systems. Further, theories of
disease distribution and the underlying agendas, ideologies, and
motivations contributing to their implicit or explicit use in turn shape
what data get analyzed, how the analysis is interpreted, and what
visualizations are used to disseminate findings (Krieger, 2011). Misuse or poor
use of data analysis and visualization tools can contribute to obscuring
health inequities, leaving out certain subpopulations or misrepresenting
trends in disease distribution, resulting in poor policy decisions and
inadequate or misleading data to inform community and advocacy
organizing for health justice. Therefore, not only is the availability
of robust health information systems important, so too is the use of
appropriate methods and a health equity lens in their analyses.

Using routine information systems to inform disease prevention is not a
21st or even 20th century concept. In 1829, William Farr, a "Compiler of
Abstracts" at the General Register included a letter to the Register's
first report which stated that

> *"Diseases are more easily prevented than cured, and the first step to
> their prevention is the discovery of their exciting causes. The
> Registry will show the agency of these causes by numerical facts and
> measure the intensity of their influence and will collect information
> on the laws of vitality with the variation in these laws in the two
> sexes at different ages and the influence of civilisation, occupation,
> locality, seasons and other physical agencies whether in generating
> diseases and inducing death or in improving the public health"
> (Whitehead, 2000).*

In the US, linking of public health data to US census-based
socioeconomic data was carried out by the National Tuberculosis
Association in the 1920s and 1930s (Green, 1932; Nathan, 1932).
Similarly, cancer epidemiologists have used geocoded data to generate
and stratify cancer incidence, categorizing social groups using
variables defined in relation to "race/ethnicity," sex, and socioeconomic
position, for many decades (Krieger, 2001). Of note, US health data have
long been reported by US government agencies (federal, state, and local)
stratified by "race" and "sex," informed by a long history of biological
essentialism that treats these variables as a matter of innate biology,
with no attention to inequitable racial, gender, or class relations
(Krieger, 2021; Hunter et al, 2005). Adding socioeconomic data to the mix can aid with understanding
the contribution of socioeconomic inequities to racialized and gender
health inequities, but with the caveat that the 20th century CE
framework of eugenics (whose shadow continues to be cast well into the
21st c CE) also has held that people's socioeconomic position reflects
their genetic inheritance (Krieger, 2018; Levine, 2017).

Despite these early emphases on social metrics as critical in
understanding inequitable and differential population rates and
distributions of morbidity and mortality, the integration of
socioeconomic data in national surveillance systems has been slow. A
recent OECD report on national monitoring systems for health
inequalities by socioeconomic status found that only seven of the 26
high-income countries included in the study had national routine
monitoring systems with regular reports on socioeconomic inequalities in
health over time (Frank and Matsunaga, 2020).

When the first *Public Health Disparities Geocoding Project* was
launched, it presented a solution in the form of area-based
socioeconomic measures (ABSMs) where multilevel approaches to
understanding area-based measures, classified by socioeconomic
characteristics, could be used to calculate stratified rates and render
the invisible, visible. The project articulated the lack of a
standardized approach in the choice of geographic levels and types of
ABSMs used for monitoring disease distribution, making comparison across
heterogeneous methods difficult.

The project took on the task of identifying which ABSMs would be most
apt for monitoring socioeconomic inequalities in health and at what
geographic level. Findings suggested that census tract poverty level -
defined as "percent of persons below poverty" - was most apt (Krieger et
al, 2003).

Since then, there has been significant development in both the
conceptualization of geocoded health disparities, types of ABSMs, and
the technologies available to capture, analyze, and visualize them.

Many ABSMs have been developed around the world. Globally,
the Gini coefficient is one of the standards for measuring income
inequality (with caveats around its use beyond larger aggregations and
issues around spatial social polarization) (Shaw et al, 2007; Krieger et
al, 2016). In Canada, examples include the Socioeconomic Factor Index
(SEFI), the General Deprivation Index (GDI), and the Deprivation Index
for Health and Welfare Planning for Quebec (DIHWPQ) (Schuurman et al,
2007). Starting in the early 20th c CE, the UK began using the Registrar
General's social class classification systems (an ad hoc approach based
on skill-level demarcations in occupational class), which in was
replaced in 2000 by the theoretically-grounded National Statistics
Socio-economic Classification (NS-SEC), which emphasizes employment
relations and the conditions of occupations (UK Office of National Statistics, 2022). Also commonly used is the English Index of Multiple Deprivation (McLennan et al, 2019). In the US, studies
have generated or used composite indices of deprivation or social
vulnerability based on selected census variables (O'Campo et al, 2008;
Messer et al, 2006; Hu et al, 2021; ATSDR 2022).

However, one problem common to many indices, and also single-variable
measures (such as percent below poverty), is that they do not provide
insight into the power relations and spatial social polarization driving
health inequities (Krieger et al, 2016; Krieger et al, 2017). For example, the metric "percent below
poverty," while useful for describing socioeconomic gradients in health,
notably provides no information on the income distribution of those
"above poverty," which can range from barely above poverty to extremely
affluent. Similarly, a commonly used variable in the US, such as
"percent of population classified as being Black Americans" says nothing
about the distribution of other racialized groups and the social
relationships that are core to racialized economic segregation. An
additional problem is that diverse metrics intended to measure
inequality across the full population distribution, such as the Gini
coefficient or the dissimilarity index (which measures the proportion of
a population that would need to move within a geographic area to achieve
evenness of distribution), is that they are only meaningful at higher
geographic levels (Krieger et al, 2016; Krieger et al, 2017). At issue is how, within the US, policies and
practices, past and present, to generate and enforce racialized economic
segregation have worked to buttress neighborhood boundaries, especially
to keep some areas white and affluent and relegate lower-income
populations, disproportionately Black, Latinx, Indigenous and immigrant
in the US to underdeveloped neighborhoods lacking resources for people
to thrive (Krieger et al, 2016; Krieger et al, 2017; Rothstein, 2017; Bailey et al, 2017).

A new approach to capturing the extreme range of concentrations of
economic deprivation and privilege, termed the "Index of Concentration
at the Extremes" (ICE), was developed in 2001 by Douglass Massey, a
leading US scholar on residential segregation (Massey, 2001; Massey, 1996; Massey, 2012). This measure, which ranges from -1 to 1 and captures the extent to which an area's population is concentrated into
one end of the other of extremes of privilege and deprivation, notably
can be used meaningfully at multiple levels of geography, from census
block on up to counties and higher. In recent years, members of our
*Public Health Disparities Geocoding Project* team have produced work
promoting use of the ICE in public health research, and also extending
Massey's original work to develop ICE measures that quantify not only
racialized residential segregation but also racialized economic
segregation, with the latter comprising the first metric of its kind
(Krieger et al, 2016; Krieger et al, 2016B; Scally et al, 2018; Krieger
et al, 2018; Chen & Krieger, 2021; Krieger et al, 2015). The intent is to provide insight
into who and what drives health inequities, not just focus solely on
those harmed (Krieger et al, 2010; Beckfield, 2018; Bambra et al, 2021; Bailey et al, 2017).

The Covid-19 pandemic - due to the social and geographic patterning in
the spread of the virus and associated hospitalizations and deaths - has
highlighted the critical need for improved surveillance systems and
systematic monitoring of health inequities (Presidential Task Force, 2021; Bambra, 2021). As a result, the
*Public Health Disparities Geocoding Project* has compiled resources to
support efforts in carrying out the analyses of health inequities in
this context (Krieger, Chen, Waterman, 2020).

The 2020 [[update to the
project]{.underline}](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/thegeocodingproject/covid-19-resources/),
shared in May 2020 in the thick of the first months of the pandemic,
provides:

-   List of conceptual and empirical publications

-   List of variables constructed using the US Census American Community
    Survey (ACS) data

-   R code for extracting ABSMs from the ACS and replicating analyses in
    the published empirical papers

The *Public Health Disparities Geocoding Project 2.0* training (held online 
in June and July 2022) and now available through this manual builds on the 
work of our team throughout the pandemic and is offering an updated and revised 
training on why & how to analyze population health and health inequities in 
relation to census tract, county, and other georeferenced societal and 
environmental data. Because the area-based metrics we employ in this study 
include diverse social metrics, no longer restricted solely to economic 
measures, we employ the updated terminology of "area-based social metrics" 
-- which we continue to abbreviate as "ABSMs."

This online manual will walk through each step of the training
including:

-   Chapter 2: Getting Set Up

-   Chapter 3: Getting your Data

-   Chapter 4: Visualizing your Data

-   Chapter 5: Analyzing your data

-   Chapter 6: Case Study - Premature Mortality

-   Chapter 7: Case Study - Breast Cancer Mortality

-   Chapter 8: Case Study - Cook County Covid-19

-   Chapter 10: Case Study - Comparing County Analyses of Inequities in Health Insurance using ACS vs. CDC PLACES data (2019)
    Survey

-   Chapter 11: Conclusions
