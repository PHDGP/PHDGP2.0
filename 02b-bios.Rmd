Nancy Krieger, PhD (she/her) (Principle Investigator for The Public Health
Disparities Training Project 2.0) is Professor of Social Epidemiology and American Cancer
Society Clinical Research Professor, in the Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences,
Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH), and also Director of the HSPH
Interdisciplinary Concentration on Women, Gender, and Health. She is an internationally
recognized social epidemiologist (PhD, Epidemiology, UC Berkeley, 1989), with a
background in biochemistry, philosophy of science, and history of public health, plus 35+
years of activism involving social justice, science, and health. Dr. Krieger’s work
addresses: (1) conceptual frameworks to understand, analyze, and improve the people’s
health, including her ecosocial theory of disease distribution focused on embodiment
and equity; (2) etiologic research on societal determinants of population health and
health inequities, including structural racism and other types of adverse discrimination;
and (3) methodologic research to improve monitoring of health inequities. She launched
the initial Public Health Disparities Geocoding Project in the late 1990s to improve
monitoring, analysis and action on the entangled impacts of social class and racism on
population health and health inequities.

Sciences at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. His research focuses on
methods for analyzing and understanding social inequities in health, particularly in
relation to structural racism and socioeconomic deprivation. As a methodologist, Dr.
Chen's interests include development of methods for geospatial and spatiotemporal
analysis, disease mapping, and causal inference in social epidemiology. Dr. Chen is also
Associate Director of the PhD in Population Health Sciences Program in Harvard
University's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and teaches several quantitative
research methods courses at the school.

Sudipta Saha (he/him) is a Population Health Sciences PhD student in the
Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences at Harvard University. His current
research interests are at the intersection of social epidemiologic theories and
infectious disease models. He is particularly interested in treating racial capitalism as
a fundamental cause of health inequities to understand/illustrate how broader
political-economic forces shape such inequities. He has a BSc in Microbiology from the
University of Toronto, and a Master of Science in Global Health and Population at
Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

modeling health outcomes and characterizing health inequities. His ongoing work is
focused on COVID-19, epigenetic aging, survey data collection and analysis,
discrimination, and area based social metrics. Christian is particularly interested in
the application of flexible machine learning approaches in causal inference as well
as the use of data visualization for the effective communication of scientific findings
and their associated uncertainty.
