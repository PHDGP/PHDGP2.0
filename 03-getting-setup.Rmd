# Getting Setup with R and RStudio {#getting-setup}

*By: Christian Testa*

We recommend before moving on, readers should download and install R and RStudio
and the recommended R packages and dependencies.

### Principles for Reproducible Workflow and Programming

Two principles underlie why R and RStudio have been chosen to use throughout
these course materials. First, as a matter of equity, the use of free (both free
to use and freely licensed) software such as R and RStudio removes financial and
administrative barriers to engaging with our work and facilitates the inclusion
of people from more diverse backgrounds in science. Second, data analysis and
science should be open and transparent wherever and whenever possible, so as to
promote the external reproduction, verification, and validation of findings.

The code examples in this book assume familiarity with the R programming
language. You can still benefit from this book by reading the exposition without
focusing on the code examples if you are not very familiar with R programming.

If you want to become more familiar with R programming, you may want to start by
familiarizing yourself with R. The *R for Data Science* book, available free and
online here: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/, which provides a free, online, accessible
introduction.

## Downloading and Installing R and RStudio

In order to follow along with these resources, you will need to have R and
RStudio installed and setup.  You can download R from
https://www.r-project.org/. You can download RStudio from
https://www.rstudio.com/.

## Basic Features of R

Throughout this text, the example code given will depend on various R packages
which are all available free and open-source, easily installed in R with the 
`install.packages` function. 

To work through the case examples here, you will need to install at least the 
following packages: 

```{r}
#| echo = TRUE,
#| eval = FALSE
# for data manipulation and visualization
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("Hmisc") # mostly for the weighted quantile function
install.packages("fastDummies") # for creating "dummy"/ "indicator" variables


# for retrieving census data
install.packages("tidycensus") # note the special instructions below

# for mapping
install.packages("sf") # note the special instructions below
install.packages("mapview")
install.packages("tigris")
install.packages("leaflet")


# for visualization/color palettes
install.packages("RColorBrewer")
install.packages("viridis")
install.packages("cowplot")

# for multilevel modeling
install.packages("lme4")

# for spatial modeling
install.packages("INLA",repos=c(getOption("repos"),INLA="https://inla.r-inla-download.org/R/stable"), dep=TRUE)

```


### Note about "compiling from source"

If, when installing these packages, R prompts you asking whether you would like
to install these packages “from source,” you do not need to. Sometimes compiling
from source can be more difficult than installing the pre-built packages from
CRAN if there are compilation errors.

### Tidycensus Special Instructions

You need to register for a Census API key as part of the setup 
procedures to use `tidycensus`. 

See the instructions for installing [on the tidycensus
website](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/articles/basic-usage.html).

Note that you only need to run the `census_api_key("YOUR API KEY GOES HERE")` 
command once. 

### sf Special Instructions

For the `sf` package, there are additional instructions here: https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/
which are OS (Mac, Windows, Linux) specific, which walk through getting setup
with the `gdal` (or Geospatial Data Abstraction Library, a translator library
for raster and vector geospatial data formats) which is a dependency of `sf`.

### INLA Install Instructions

The code above installs the stable version of INLA.  Should you ever need
to upgrade your installation, instructions are online here:
