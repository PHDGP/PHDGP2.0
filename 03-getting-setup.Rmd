# Getting Setup with R and RStudio {#getting-setup}

We recommend before moving on, readers should take care of
downloading and installing R and RStudio as well as getting 
some dependencies installed.
    
## Downloading and Installing R and RStudio

In order to follow along with these resources, you will need to have R and
RStudio installed and setup.  You can download R from
https://www.r-project.org/. You can download RStudio from
https://www.rstudio.com/.

## Basic Features of R

Throughout this text, the example code given will depend on various R packages
which are all available free and open-source, easily installed in R with the 
`install.packges` function. 

To work through the case examples here, you will need to install at least the 
following packages: 

```{r}
#| echo = TRUE,
#| eval = FALSE
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("tidycensus")
install.packages("sf")
install.packages("mapview")
```

For the `tidycensus` package, users need to follow the instructions here:
https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/articles/basic-usage.html to set up their
Census API key.

For the `sf` package, there are additional instructions here:
https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/ for getting setup with the `gdal` (or
Geospatial Data Abstraction Library, a translator library for raster and vector
geospatial data formats) which is a dependency of `sf`.


:::: {.infobox .caution}
The code examples in this book will assume some familiarity with the R
programming language. You can still benefit from this book by reading the
exposition without focusing on the code examples if you are not very familiar
with R programming.

If you want to become more familiar with R programming, you may want to start by
familiarizing yourself with R. The *R for Data Science* book, available free and
online here: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/, which provides a free, online, accessible
introduction.
