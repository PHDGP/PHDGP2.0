# Visualizing your data {#visualizing-your-data}

Data visualization is a critical component in communicating and advocating for
health equity as it makes data accessible and transparent.  However, it is not 
without its pitfalls, and in this chapter we will discuss some of the important
points to consider when visualizing data for advancing health equity. 

Firstly, as a matter of accessibility, we strive to use colorblind friendly
color palettes when using color so that individuals with one of the different
kinds of colorblindness can still interpret our visualizations. 
We encourage you to learn more about colorblindness and colorblind friendly
palettes from a number of resources (Katsnelson, 2021) (Ou, 2021). The color
vision deficiency simulator from the `colorblindr` package is especially helpful
in testing if a visual you are creating is colorblind friendly.

One of the main points we urge caution around with respect to the visualization
and mapping of area based health outcome data are the presentation of rates
which are unstable due to small population sizes.  As a broader principle, we 
emphasize the need for careful choice of the area level at which results are
presented. In part, this is because it is well established that changing the
areal units into which data are aggregated and analyzed can change the
relationships observed in the data. This is known as the Modifiable Areal Unit
Problem, which can be read about in (Wong 2004) and (Buzzelli 2020). Of note,
choice of area should not be arbitrary, but should be guided by a priori
reasons, including which areas make the most sense to use to answer which
questions. For example, analyses of population-wide health inequities within the
entire US may wish to use census tract or county level data, whereas analyses
more specifically focused on the political geography of health inequities may
wish to use areas with political boundaries, e.g., state or congressional
legislative districts [ref].

For example at small area levels like the Census tract level, the underlying
population may be so small that the health outcomes observed are quite noisy
because a single additional case represents a large shift in the rate. In such a
situation, it it could potentially be erroneous to infer that the Census tract
with the highest observed rate has the greatest underlying risk because it could
be an artifact of noise. This motivates the need for spatial smoothing, and we
encourage the use of spatially smoothed estimates for choropleth maps showing
health outcome rates to avoid such a potential pitfall.
As an introduction to these pitfalls, we recommend the [Pitfalls to avoid](https://mgimond.github.io/Spatial/pitfalls-to-avoid.html) chapter from (Gimond 2022).


It is worthwhile to remark on how different areal units can either center or
marginalize social groups based on the geographic boundaries employed. It is
also crucial to be clear about which social groups are excluded or inaccurately
represented in the area-based data, including but not limited to people who are
unhoused, incarcerated, otherwise institutionalized or experiencing other kinds
of marginalization. Warranting scrutiny are the protocols employed by the data
holders to assign addresses and/or georeferenced codes to the records of persons
who are not living in non-institutional residences, as well as who is counted
towards the population totals of the specified geographic areas.As an example,
one lesson we have learned from analyzing Boston area mortality data is that it
can be quite useful to know the locations of and areas containing homeless
shelters, because we have found that individuals designated as experiencing
homelessness at the time of their death have had their place of death in the
residential field of the death certificate listed as the address of the homeless
shelter. The net impact can be to inflate the mortality rate of the census
tracts in which these shelters are located.

Oftentimes georeferenced and geocoded data will have anomalous or idiosyncratic
features such as areas where the rate appears to be infinite because population
estimates are zero for that area despite having observed health outcomes,
especially if the data are for small areas or particular sub-populations.
Although there is not a single solution to these problems, a key starting place
is to examine the data critically to understand the socially-produced data
protocols and social distribution of the populations at issue, so as to be on
the lookout for these very real problems that arise from and manifest social
spatial inequities. We accordingly encourage data analysts and visualizers to
consider carefully the impacts the choice of areas, their boundaries, the
processes by which the locations of people are assigned to these areas (whether
as “numerators” or “denominators”), and the power relations affecting who is
likely to be geocoded to these areas – and who is missed – whether as a “case”
or member of the population from which the cases arise (i.e., “denominator”).


To start to develop a wider perspective on how data visualization and mapping
can be used, we list below a range of recommended books and articles. Because
data visualization and mapping are powerful tools to communicate (or
miscommunicate) data, it is critical to be aware of how they can reflect bias
and tell lies (Deluca and Nelson, 2017), (Fleckenstein 1991), (Monmonier 2021),
as well as reveal powerful truths (Koch 2017om Koch outlines the history of
disease mapping in his book Disease Maps, Epidemics on the Ground (2011), and in
his 2017 follow-up book, Ethics in Everyday Places: Mapping Moral Stress,
Distress, and Injury, he takes a broader perspective.

  # discussed above:
  - ggplot2, color palettes & accessibility 
  - mapping point estimates vs uncertainty 
  - references: "how maps lie";  tom koch disease maps, "ethics in everyday places: mapping moral stress, distress, and injury"
  - point layers vs. choropleth layers 
  - visualizing raw data may be unstable 
  
  # TODO: 
  do we cover these topics here again, in addition to in "getting your data"?
  - visualizing health measures (actually getting to look at maps)
  - showing how mapview helps to reality-check your understanding of the geography 
  based on including streetmap features, satellite imagery, etc.
