# Visualizing your data {#visualizing-your-data}

Data visualization is a critical component in communicating and advocating for
health equity as it makes data accessible and transparent.  However, it is not 
without its pitfalls, and in this chapter we will discuss some of the important
points to consider when visualizing data for advancing health equity. 

Firstly, as a matter of accessibility, we strive to use colorblind friendly
color palettes when using color so that individuals with one of the different
kinds of colorblindness can still interpret our visualizations. 
We encourage you to learn more about colorblindness and colorblind friendly
palettes from a number of resources (Katsnelson, 2021) (Ou, 2021). The color
vision deficiency simulator from the `colorblindr` package is especially helpful
in testing if a visual you are creating is colorblind friendly.

recommend checking out the online, free book: 
[ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](https://ggplot2-book.org/).

If you are looking for help learning how to work with spatial data in R, we recommend
the following free, online books:

One of the main points we urge caution around with respect to the visualization
and mapping of area based health outcome data are the presentation of rates
which are unstable due to small population sizes.  As a broader principle, we 
emphasize the need for careful choice of the area level at which results are
presented. In part, this is because it is well established that changing the
areal units into which data are aggregated and analyzed can change the
relationships observed in the data. This is known as the Modifiable Areal Unit
Problem, which can be read about in (Wong 2004) and (Buzzelli 2020).  

For example at small area levels like the Census tract level, the underlying
population may be so small that the health outcomes observed are quite noisy
because a single additional case represents a large shift in the rate. In such a
situation, it wouldn't necessarily be correct to say that the Census tract where
the highest rates were observed are where the greatest underlying risk is
because it could be an artifact of noise. This motivates the need for spatial
smoothing, and we encourage the use of spatially smoothed estimates for
choropleth maps showing health outcome rates to avoid such a potential pitfall.
As an introduction to these pitfalls, we recommend the [Pitfalls to avoid](https://mgimond.github.io/Spatial/pitfalls-to-avoid.html) chapter from (Gimond 2022).


It is worthwhile to remark on how different areal units can either center or
marginalize social groups based on the geographic boundaries drawn -- and
moreover addressing the question of who are excluded or inaccurately represented
in our data (often those experiencing homelessness, incarceration, or other
kinds of marginalization) because of the process by which our data are geocoded
is critical to ensuring that our efforts towards advancing health equity are
hitting their mark. As an example, one lesson we have learned from analyzing
Boston area mortality data is that it can be quite useful to know the locations
of and areas containing homeless shelters as some individuals experiencing
homelessness at the time of their death had these as coded as their address of
residence. Oftentimes georeferenced and geocoded data will have anomalous or
idiosyncratic features such as areas where the rate appears to be infinite
because population estimates are zero for that area despite having observed
health outcomes, especially if the data are for small areas or particular
sub-populations. There is not a single solution to these problems that does not
vary regardless of each individual data analysis projects' context, but we
encourage data analysts and visualizers to carefully consider the impacts the
choice of boundaries have and the power structures built into whose experiences
they center or marginalize.

To start to develop a wider perspective on how data visualization and mapping
can be used, have a few books and articles we would recommend. Because data
visualization and mapping are simply tools we can use to communicate data
that we believe are important to share, they are certainly capable of reflecting
bias and telling lies (Deluca and Nelson, 2017), (Fleckenstein 1991),
(Monmonier 2021).  Tracing the history of some of those who were first
interested in understanding the geographic distribution of burden associated
with human disease and able to make maps, Tom Koch outlines the history of
disease mapping in his book Disease Maps, Epidemics on the Ground (2011). In his
followup work, Ethics in Everyday Places: Mapping Moral Stress, Distress, and
Injury, he takes a broader perspective.

  - ggplot2, color palettes & accessibility 
  - mapping point estimates vs uncertainty 
  - references: "how maps lie";  tom koch disease maps, "ethics in everyday places: mapping moral stress, distress, and injury"
  - point layers vs. choropleth layers 
  - visualizing raw data may be unstable 
  
  haven't done this yet:
  - visualizing health measures (actually getting to look at maps)
  
  - showing how mapview helps to reality-check your understanding of the geography 
  based on including streetmap features, satellite imagery, etc.
