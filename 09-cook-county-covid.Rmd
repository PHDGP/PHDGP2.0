# Case Study 3: COVID-19 Mortality in Cook County (March 2020 - March 2022) {#cook-county-covid}


## Introduction 

In this case study, the outcome of interest is COVID-19 mortality in Cook County. The impact of COVID-19 has been marked by inequities by racialized/ethnic group and socioeconomic position. Here we investigate disparities in COVID-19 mortality, with a focus on comparing risks between Black Hispanic and non-Hispanic, White non-Hispanic, and Hispanic populations.

The Cook County Medical Examiner has made a dataset with COVID-19 related deaths publicly available with the following intent: 

>  Cook County Government has created the Medical Examiner COVID-19 Dashboard to provide direct, transparent access to critical information about COVID-19 deaths in the County for public health agencies, medical professionals, first responders, journalists, policymakers and residents. The Medical Examinerâ€™s Office encourages visitors to use this data to explore trends, identify areas of concern and take appropriate action. The data can be utilized to identify communities that are most severely impacted by the virus and can inform proactive public policy.

Data Source: https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/Public-Safety/Medical-Examiner-Case-Archive-COVID-19-Related-Dea/3trz-enys

The death records in this dataset includes individual-level fields for "Race" and "Latino", from which we obtain social membership in racialized/ethnic groups. The dataset also includes residential Zip Codes, which we can use to link to area-based social measures (ABSMs) from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2015-19. We will explore how membership in racialized/ethnic groups and ABSMs is associated with COVID-19 mortality. 

## Motivation, Research Questions, and Learning Objectives

This case study focuses on the following research questions: 

  - What are the differences in COVID-19 mortality rates by racialized group accounting for age?
  
  - What are the gradients in overall COVID-19 mortality in relation to ABSMs measuring: racialized group composition, the ICE for racialized economic segregation, percent of population living below the poverty line, percent of people living in crowded housing, and median income;

  - What are the gradients in COVID-19 mortality by racialized group in relation to the ABSMs
  
  - What is the spatial variation in COVID-19 mortality by racialized group, and how is this related to ABSMs?
  

In today's case example using these data, we'll show you how you can use the `tidycensus` package to download relevant area based population estimates and sociodemographic measures from the ACS. 

:::: {.infobox .dataWrangling}
We'll show you how we cleaned the data and merged in data from the ACS in the **Cleaning the Data** section. However, we're also providing you a cleaned dataset that should allow you to pick up and follow along from the **Visualizing Your Data** section onwards.
::::


## Approach

  - To look at overall differences in COVID-19 mortality by racialized group, we will model aggregate mortality rates across Cook County by racialized group
  
  - To look at gradients in relation to ABSMs, we will model overall ZCTA-level mortality rates for each ABSM of interest.
  
  - To look at gradients in relation to ABSMs by racialized group, we will model ZCTA-level mortality separately for each racialized group and each ABSM.
  
  - To explore spatial variation we will use spatial models.

## Dependencies 

These are the packages that you will need to run the code in this case example. Once you copy and run the code below to load the dependencies, you can jump ahead to the **Visualizing Your Data** Section if you want.

```{r load packages} 
#| eval = FALSE,
#| warning = FALSE,
#| message = FALSE

# mission critical packages
library(tidycensus) 
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(tigris)
library(mapview)
library(INLA)
library(spdep)

# nice to have packages
library(magrittr) # for the %<>% and %$% pipe
library(janitor)
library(purrr)

library(leaflet)
library(scales)
```

## Cleaning the Data

### Denominator Data

Here we will use `tidycensus` to download relevant variables from the 2015-19 ACS dataset. The complete list of variables can be viewed online here: https://api.census.gov/data/2019/acs/acs5/variables.html. You will need a U.S. Census API key to download the data, which you can obtain from here: https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html. The key is for personal use here only, so it has been redacted here. 

We will be looking at a range of different ABSMs, and we also require age-stratified populations by racialized group. You can browse the variables to identify which tables contain the variables you need. 

:::: {.infobox .dataWrangling}
It can be helpful to identify patterns in the variable names to efficiently query the Census API. In the code below you will see an approach that does not require us to type out all the variable names. Can you think of more efficient ways to query the API?

```{r cleaning the data}
#| eval = FALSE,

#Get a list of the variable names
acs_vars <- tidycensus::load_variables(2019, dataset = 'acs5')


# the racialized group and age-group stratified population estimates from ACS are
# in the B01001 table.
# 
# B01001_001 through _049 are the sex/gender overall population size estimates,
# and B01001A through B01001I are the "race/ethnicity" specific tables.  For the
# "race/ethnicity" specific tables the age-groups suffixes range from _001 to _031
# 
# in the following three steps, we programmatically construct the population

  )

# for each of H, B, and I, construct B01001*_001 through _031. If you look at the variable list at the link above, you will see that the variable names constructed below correspond to total and age-sex specific population estimates for each racialized/ethnic group.

Since the Cook County Medical Examiner Case Archive data includes records on deaths where the decedents' residential ZCTAs are inside as well as outside Cook County, Illinois, we want to restrict our dataset to deaths where their county of residence was in Cook County. An issue is that ZCTAs are not neatly nested within the county borders - often part of a ZCTA can lie outside the county. 

:::: {.infobox .dataWrangling}
How would you work with this issue of ZCTAs crossing county borders? Here we calculated the percentage of an area in a ZCTA that also falls within the Cook County borders, and retained those with 90% overlap (an arbitrary threshold). Would you use a different threshold? We also had to deal with issues of parts of Lake Michigan (bordering Cook County's east coast) being included in some shapefiles but not others.

:::: {.infobox .interpretation}
Note that the unit of geography for analysis is the US census-defined Zip Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA), which is related to but not identical with the US Postal Service ZIP Code (which is a unit of mail delivery, reflecting postal carrier routes, such that a given spatial area can encompass several ZIP Codes). To create ZCTAs, the US Census assigns each census block the most frequently occurring ZIP Code within the block. For technical information about ZCTAs, see: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/zctas.html. This means that ZCTAs and zip codes may not cover the same area exactly. A discussion of pitfalls to keep in mind when using ZCTAs linked to residential Zip Code can be found in this paper https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1447194/ .

We have added discretized (cut, i.e. categorical) versions of the different ABSMs.  This is because this helps to allow the model flexibility to fit nonlinear responses with increasing levels in these covariates.  Alternative approaches could involve fitting the models with smoothing splines on these variables instead, but we aren't showing that here today. We used Illinois-wide distribution of ABSMs at the ZCTA level to create quantiles for all variables except poverty. For poverty, we use pre-specified cutpoints. 

:::: {.infobox .interpretation}
Here we set the cutpoints for the continuous ABSMs based on the state-wide distribution of ZCTAs. How might this affect our interpretation? How might your research question and context affect how you decide what the ABSM cutpoints are?
::::

:::: {.infobox .communication}
How might the selection of cutpoints affect your visualizations? How might your cutpoints change depending on what you want to communicate through the map?

We have a few remaining necessary cleaning steps to perform before we're ready to model these data. 

We have to make sure our factor variables have appropriate reference levels set. Typically we set the reference level as the most privileged group so that we can frame the results as "the _____ group has X times the mortality rate of the reference group." 

```{r final cleaning steps}
#| echo = TRUE,
#| eval = FALSE
# prepare data for modeling  ----------------------------------------------

# remove infinite or NA mortality rates since they will cause errors in trying
# to fit the models
df_prepped <- df %>% filter(
  is.finite(mortality_per100k_py) &
    ! is.na(mortality_per100k_py))

# ungroup
df_prepped %<>% ungroup()

# make the most privileged the reference category
df_prepped %<>% mutate(
  race_ethnicity = forcats::fct_relevel(factor(race_ethnicity), "White, non-Hispanic"),
  age_group = age_group,
  ICEraceinc_cut = forcats::fct_rev(ICEraceinc_cut),
  median_income_cut = forcats::fct_rev(median_income_cut)
)

# rename the estimate variable to 'population_estimate' to be more clear
df_prepped %<>% rename(population_estimate = estimate)

# save data 
# saveRDS(df_prepped, here("data/09-cook-county-covid/cook_county_mortality_cleaned.rds"))
```

## Visualizing Your Data

If you want to start by using the clean dataset you can start from this point on. Now that we have a clean dataset, we can create some exploratory visualizations. In the code chunk above we do some exploratory visualizations of the data. The first series of maps show the crude mortality rates by ZCTA, racialized group and Age Group. **To see a larger version of this or any other image on the online version of the book right click and select open image in new tab.**

#| eval = TRUE,
#| echo = FALSE

#| eval = TRUE,
#| echo = FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here(

```

This figure shows the histogram of these rates to visualizate the distribution of the data.
```{r image raw rates histogram}
#| eval = TRUE,
#| echo = FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here(
  "images/09-cook-county-covid/raw_rates_histogram.png"))
```

This figure shows the relationship between mortality rates and population size in each strata. 
```{r image raw rates scatter}
#| eval = TRUE,
#| echo = FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here(

You can see that there are a number of zero-counts, and that rates are noisier when population sizes are smaller.

:::: {.infobox .interpretation}
The figure above illustrates that there is a lot more variability of mortality rates at the ZCTA-level when the population count is small. Thus we need to be careful when interpreting extreme values obtained in small areas.

A map of crude rates of small areas with low person-time at risk may be misleading. It may identify some areas as having extreme rates, but this may be just due to chance and low population at risk.

The code above produces a series of maps that visualize the different ABSMs we will use in this analysis. Note that Chicago is situated in Cook County.
```{r image racialized group composition map}
#| echo = FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here(
  "images/09-cook-county-covid/racial_ethnic_composition.png"))
```
```{r image median income map}
#| echo = FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here(
  "images/09-cook-county-covid/median_income.png"))
```
```{r image ICE map}
#| echo = FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here(
  "images/09-cook-county-covid/ICEraceinc.png"))
```
```{r image crowding map}
#| echo = FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here(

```
```{r poverty map}
#| echo = FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here(
  "images/09-cook-county-covid/poverty.png"))
```

:::: {.infobox .interpretation}
In contrast to the other ABSMs, the Index of Concentration at the Extremes (ICE) highlights racialized economic segregation (i.e., race/ethnicity + income). It measures the extent to which an areaâ€™s population is concentrated into extremes of deprivation and privilege. It is scaled from -1 to 1: a value of -1 means that 100% of the population is concentrated in the most deprived group (in this analysis, conceptualized as the population of color in low-income households), and a value of 1 means that 100% of the population is concentrated into the most privileged group (in this analysis, conceptualized as the White non-Hispanic population in high-income households).

:::: {.infobox .communication}
The maps above utilize various color scales. How do you think this can affect communication through maps? Do you have a preference? When might you use a diverging versus continuous color scale? Sometimes in can also be useful to plot an interactive map, shown below.
::::

We can utilize the mapview package to plot interactive graphs. 
```{r data load}
#| eval = TRUE,
#| echo = FALSE
# load data so we can use mapview on it 
df <- readRDS("./data/09-cook-county-covid/cook_county_mortality_cleaned.rds")
```

```{r mapview example}
#| echo = TRUE,
#| eval = TRUE
# launch an interactive map to view Cook County ICEraceinc by zip code
mapview::mapview(df, zcol = "ICEraceinc")
```

```{r mapview example two}
#| echo = FALSE,
#| eval = FALSE
# launch an interactive map to view Cook County ICEraceinc by zip code
# mapview::mapview(df %>%
#                    group_by(geoid) %>%
#                    dplyr::summarize(deaths = sum(deaths),
#                              person_time = sum(person_time)) %>%
#                    mutate(mortality_per100k_py = (deaths/person_time) * 1e5), 
#                  zcol = "mortality_per100k_py",
#                  legend = T,
#                  layer.name = 'Mortality per 100,000 person years')
```



## Analyzing the data

### Differences in COVID-19 mortality rates by racialized group

First, we can take a look at the COVID-19 mortality rates by racialized group in aggregate. Because we are aggregating up to the County level, we are not looking at gradients by ABSMs.

```{r aggregation 1, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8}
#| echo = TRUE,
#| eval = FALSE

#Since we are not taking into account ABSMs in this first analysis, aggregate the data and visualize
crude_mortality <- df %>% st_drop_geometry() %>% #dplyr works faster if we drop the geometry column.
  group_by(age_group, race_ethnicity) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(population_estimate = sum(population_estimate),
            deaths = sum(deaths),
            person_time = sum(person_time)) %>%
  mutate(mortality_per100k_py = (deaths / person_time)*100000)

#plot clude mortality and confidence intervals
ggplot() + 
  geom_pointrange(
    data = crude_mortality,
    aes(
      x = age_group,
      color = race_ethnicity,
      y = mortality_per100k_py,
      ymin = epitools::pois.exact(x=deaths, pt=person_time, conf.level=0.95)[,4]*1e5,
      ymax = epitools::pois.exact(x=deaths, pt=person_time, conf.level=0.95)[,5]*1e5, #CIs calculated using pos.exact from epitools package

```{r image crude rates by racialized group}

We can fit models to the aggregate data to adjust for age and obtain relative risk estimates.

                           data = crude_mortality, family = quasipoisson(link = 'log'))

#Negative binomial model from MASS package
crude_negbin_model <- MASS::glm.nb(deaths ~ race_ethnicity + age_group + offset(log(person_time / 1e5)),
                           data = crude_mortality)

### Hierarchical and Spatial Models

In the examples above, we modeled the associations between individual- and area-based measures with the outcome in aggregate across the county. However, we may also be interested in modeling the risk of mortality in each ZCTA. This can help us better understand the spatial distribution of risk. 

We may also want to take into account the fact that these ZCTAs are likely not independent of each other, but rather related to each other in a spatially structured fashion. That is, ZCTAs that are next to each other are more likely to have similar rates than ZCTAs that are farther apart.

One of the *statistical* challenges of estimating the risk in each ZCTA (or any other small areal unit), is that, due to small underlying populations and sparse events interspersed in time, small-area estimation (SAE) of risk and incidence rates can be quite unstable. This has led to the use of various strategies to smooth estimates, by borrowing information from nearby spatial units. Thus, by accounting for the fact that ZCTAs that are closer together are more likely to be similar, we can obtain spatially smoothed risk estimates. 

Put another way: let us say that a particular part of the county has high mortality rates. If we look at observations over a limited period of time, in each specific ZCTA separately, we may miss this just by chance due to the fact that the populations in individual ZCTAs are small, and thus fewer events are observed. However, if we pool information from neighboring ZCTAs, we would be able to obtain a more stable estimate of the risk.

Hierarchical Bayesian models are a popular set of tools to conduct such estimations. Often, in such approaches, we will model the Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR), standardized by age. The relative risk or SMR in area $i$, ($\theta_i$) is obtained by dividing the expected count ($E_i$) by the observed count $O_i$). How we calculate the "expected count" depends on the objectives of our study and analysis. For example, if we know that there are strong age effects, and want to estimate excess risk after accounting for age-composition differences between ZCTAs, we can take the age-strata-specific mortality rates for all of Cook County, and apply it to the age-distribution of each ZCTA. This tells us what the "expected" mortality count would be if each ZCTA experienced Cook County's average age-specific mortality rates. One could also standardize by composition in relation to racialized groups, but then we would not be able to estimate how membership in racialized groups was associated with mortality. Similarly, age-standardization precludes the ability to look at the interaction between age and membership in racialized groups, for example.

In this case, we will estimate the SMR using age-standardization. For each racialized group in each ZCTA, we obtain the age standardized SMR.

```{r SMR calculation}
#| eval = FALSE,
#| echo = TRUE

## We will need to have a ZCTA specific ID number that starts from 1 eventually, so let's first make that
df <- df %>% group_by(geoid) %>%
  mutate(id = cur_group_id()) %>% ungroup()
  

## Calculate overall age-specific mortality
overall_mortality <- df %>% st_drop_geometry %>%
  group_by(age_group) %>%
  summarise(deaths = sum(deaths),
            person_time = sum(person_time)) %>%
  mutate(mortality_per_py = (deaths/person_time))


## Apply this to each ZCTA
smr_df <- df %>% st_drop_geometry %>%
  left_join(overall_mortality[, c("age_group", "mortality_per_py")], by="age_group") %>% #Join the overall age-specific mortality rates
  mutate(Exp = mortality_per_py * person_time, #Multiply the overall age-specific mortality to the person-time in each ZCTA-race-age strata %>%
         Obs = deaths) %>%
  group_by(geoid, id, race_ethnicity) %>%
  summarise(Exp = sum(Exp),
            Obs = sum(Obs),
            across(ICEraceinc:prop_white_nh_cut, ~ first(.x))) %>%
  mutate(raw_SMR = Obs/Exp,
         raw_CI95low = pois.exact(x=Obs, pt=Exp, conf.level=0.95)[,4],
         raw_CI95up = pois.exact(x=Obs, pt=Exp, conf.level=0.95)[,5]) #calculate 95% CI bounds based on Poisson parameters 


```

So, in our dataset we can calculate the Observed count $O_i$, the Expected count $E_i$ (based on age standardization), and the SMR $\theta_i$. The observed count approximately follows a Poisson distribution, such that:

$$
O_i \sim Poisson(\theta_i*E_i)
$$

That is, the observed county in any one ZCTA follows a Poisson distribution whose mean is the expected county times a relative risk / SMR. We are interested in this last component since it quantifies the "excess" or "reduced" risk in each area beyond what is "expected" by an age-composition. In our particular case, since we actually have strata of racialized groups within each ZCTA, we can create a hierarchical structure such that:

$$
O_{ij} \sim Poisson(\theta_{ij}*E_{ij})
$$

Now, we are looking at observed, expected counts and SMR within each racialized group strata $j$, within each ZCTA $i$.

Let us visualize these crude SMRs for each ZCTA-racialized group strata, along with their confidence intervals

```{r crude_SMR_plot}
#| eval = FALSE,
#| echo = TRUE

ggplot(data = smr_df %>% arrange(raw_SMR, desc(Exp)) %>% ungroup() %>% 
         mutate(order_id = row_number(),
                raw_CI95up = ifelse(raw_CI95up > 40, 40, raw_CI95up))) + # Since there are large confidence intervals, we are going to cut them off at 40 for easier visualization.
  geom_point(aes(x = order_id, y = raw_SMR), size = 0.2) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(x = order_id, ymin = raw_CI95low, ymax = raw_CI95up),
                size=0.2, alpha=0.4) +
  ylim(0,40) +
  ylab("Crude SMR") +
  xlab("ZCTA-Racialized Group strata") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())

# ggsave(here("images/09-cook-county-covid/raw_SMR_caterpillar.png"), height = 6, width = 8)
  
```


```{r image raw SMR caterpillar}
#| echo = FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("images/09-cook-county-covid/raw_SMR_caterpillar.png"))
```

Here we can see that there is large variability in these strata-specific SMRs, as well as large confidence intervals for many strata â€” especially when the predicted rate is zero.

Instead of just calculating the crude SMRs, we can model them using a Poisson log-normal model such that:

$$
log(\theta_{ij}) = \beta_0 + v_i \\
where \ v_i \sim Normal(0,\sigma^2_v)
$$

Here there is a county-wide intercept $\beta_0$, and ZCTA random effects $v_i$ that quantify the excess/reduced risk in each area from the county-wide average. Note that this is not a spatial model and we are still assuming that the ZCTAs are independent of each other.

However, this model does not have any fixed effects for individual-level variables, so we are estimating the same SMR for each racialized group strata within each ZCTA. We may do just this if we did not have any individual-level data. However, in our case, we are interested in estimating the effect of membership in racialized groups, and we can include that in the fixed part of the model such that:

$$
log(\theta_{ij}) = \beta_0 + \mathbf{\beta}(race\_ethnicity_j) + v_i \\
where \ v_i \sim Normal(0,\sigma^2_v)
$$
Here, there is a county-wide intercept for a reference racialized group $\beta_0$, $\beta$s for each other racialized group. Note that here we are modeling a constant effect for each racialized group across all ZCTAs.

Let us fit this model
```{r model 1}
#| eval = FALSE,
#| echo = TRUE

formula_poisson_mod1 <- Obs ~ 1 + race_ethnicity + f(geoid, model="iid")

model_poisson_mod1 <- inla(formula_poisson_mod1, family="poisson", data=smr_df, E=Exp, control.predictor=list(compute=TRUE), control.compute = list(dic = TRUE), verbose = F)
#The control.compute option here calculates the Deviance Information Criteria which we could use to assess model fit, especially when comparing different formulations
#The control.predictor option here computes the predicted values

# Save the fitted SMRs and their confidence intervals for each ZCTA into the dataframe we have.
smr_df <- smr_df %>% ungroup() %>%
  mutate(poissonmod1_SMR = model_poisson_mod1$summary.fitted.values$mean,
         poissonmod1_CI95low = model_poisson_mod1$summary.fitted.values$`0.025quant`,
         poissonmod1_CI95up = model_poisson_mod1$summary.fitted.values$`0.975quant`) %>%
  left_join(model_poisson_mod1$summary.random$geoid[, c("ID", "mean")], by=c("geoid"="ID")) %>%
  mutate(mean = exp(mean)) %>%
  rename(poissonmod1_RE = mean)
         
```


Next, as mentioned before, we may want to take into account the fact that neighboring ZCTAs are more closely related. One way to do this is to fit a "Besag-York-Mollie" or BYM model. This builds on the previous model, and partitions the random effects into two components - a spatially structured one, and a spatially structured one. A BYM model would be:

$$
log(\theta_{ij}) = \beta_0 + \mathbf{\beta}(race/ethnicity) + u_i + v_i \\
where \ v_i \sim Normal(0,\sigma^2_v) \ and \\
u_i \sim Conditional \ Autoregressive(W, \sigma_u^2)
$$

What this specifies is that the part of the residual variation across the ZCTAs is spatially structured such that neighboring ZCTAs have similar excess risks. This part is indicated by the new $u_i$ introduced above. After accounting for the spatial structure, further residual variation is indicated by $v_i$. After fitting such models, we can also calculate the proportion of the residual variance that is spatially structured (that is, $u_i$), and this is known as the spatial fraction.

Let us fit this model:
```{r bym model}
#| eval = FALSE,
#| echo = TRUE
#Calculate Neighbours matrix
W.nb <- poly2nb(unique(df %>% dplyr::select(id)), snap=0.001)
#W.list <- nb2listw(W.nb, style="B", zero.policy = TRUE)

# Visualize the neighbourhood matrix
coords <- st_coordinates(st_centroid(st_geometry(unique(df %>% dplyr::select(id)))))
plot(st_geometry(unique(df %>% dplyr::select(id))), border="grey")
plot(W.nb, coords, add=TRUE)

#Make adjacency matrix in format INLA can understand
nb2INLA("INLA_adj_mat", W.nb) #this saves a file in the working directory
INLA_adj_mat <- "INLA_adj_mat"

formula_bym_mod1 <- Obs ~ 1 + race_ethnicity + f(id, model="bym2", graph=INLA_adj_mat, scale.model=TRUE, constr=TRUE)

model_bym_mod1 <- inla(formula_bym_mod1, family="poisson", data=smr_df, E=Exp, 
                       control.predictor=list(compute=TRUE), 
                       control.compute = list(dic = TRUE), verbose = F)

#Save the fitted model estimates and Confidence intervals into the dataframe
smr_df <- smr_df %>% ungroup() %>%
  mutate(bymmod1_SMR = model_bym_mod1$summary.fitted.values$mean,
         bymmod1_CI95low = model_bym_mod1$summary.fitted.values$`0.025quant`,
         bymmod1_CI95up = model_bym_mod1$summary.fitted.values$`0.975quant`) %>%
  left_join(model_bym_mod1$summary.random$id[, c("ID", "mean")], by=c("id"="ID")) %>%
  mutate(mean = exp(mean)) %>%
  rename(bymmod1_RE = mean)

## Calculate Spatial Fraction
# This is a bit verbose, and INLA does not come with a built-in function to calculate this. 
# Going to create a function to calculate this

spatial_frac <- function(inla_model, numarea){
  mat.marg <- matrix(NA, nrow=numarea, ncol=100000) #create empty matrix
  m <- inla_model$marginals.random$id
  
  for (i in 1:numarea){
  #the first block of the random effects matrix contains area-specific effects (u + v), 
  #and the second block contains spatially structured residuals (u). 
  #So this is extracting from the second block of rows
    u <- m[[numarea+i]] 
    mat.marg[i,] <- inla.rmarginal(100000, u) #randomly pick 100000 values from posterior distributions of area-specific spatially structures residuals
    }
#Get empirical variance from 100000 obs
  var.u <- apply(mat.marg, 2, var) 

#Get unstructured variance
  var.v <- inla.rmarginal(100000,
                          inla.tmarginal(function(x) 1/x, 
                                         inla_model$marginals.hyperpar$`Precision for id`))

#Calculate spatially structured variance percentage
  perc.var.u <- mean(var.u/(var.u+var.v))
  return(perc.var.u)
}


spatial_frac(model_bym_mod1, length(unique(smr_df$geoid)))

```


### Comparing Fitted SMRs
Having fit all of these models, let us visualize all of their components and see what we gain from using these different types of models, and how they differ.

First, we can look at the the estimates of the fixed effects. Since our non-hierarchical models also estimated fixed effects, we can include them in this comparison, with the caveat that we are modeling SMRs in the hierarchical models.

```{r fixed_effects_plot}
#| eval = FALSE,
#| echo = TRUE

#The tidy functions from broom work on most commonly used models in R, but INLA is not one of them. 
#This is a helper function to extract coefficients and credible/"confidence" intervals.
tidy.inla <- function(x){
  
  # x = model_inla
  term_names <- rownames(x$summary.fixed)

  tibble::as_tibble(x$summary.fixed) %>%
    dplyr::mutate(terms = term_names) %>%
    dplyr::rename(term = terms,
                  estimate = mean,
                  std.error = sd,
                  conf.low = `0.025quant`, 
                  conf.high = `0.975quant`) %>%
    dplyr::select(term, estimate, std.error,
                  conf.low, conf.high)
}

coefficients_together <-
  bind_rows(crude_results,
            tidy.inla(model_poisson_mod1) %>%
              mutate(Model = "Hierarchical Poisson",
                     across(estimate:conf.high, ~ exp(.x))),
            tidy.inla(model_bym_mod1) %>%
              mutate(Model = "BYM",
                     across(estimate:conf.high, ~ exp(.x)))) %>%
  mutate(term = str_replace(term, "race_ethnicity", ""))
    
```

```{r model_results, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8}
#| eval = FALSE,
#| echo = TRUE

# visualize the effects in each model
coefficients_together %>%
  filter(term != '(Intercept)') %>%
  filter(! stringr::str_detect(term, "age_group")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = estimate, xmax = conf.high, xmin = conf.low, y = term, color = Model, shape = Model)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1, linetype = 'dashed') +
  geom_pointrange(position = position_dodge(width=.45)) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, NA), n.breaks = 4) +
  ggtitle("Comparing Coefficient Estimates for Racialized Groups from Different Models")

# ggsave(here("images/09-cook-county-covid/coefficient_comparison.png"), height = 6, width = 8)

```


```{r image coefficients comparison}
#| echo = FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("images/09-cook-county-covid/coefficient_comparison.png"))
```

One of the motivations for fitting the hierarchical models is to get stable and smoothed estimates of each ZCTA. Let us visualize the modeled SMRs for each ZCTA-racialized group strata, along with their confidence intervals, and compare them to the crude SMRs we calculated in the beginning.

```{r SMR plots}
#| eval = FALSE,
#| echo = TRUE

# Creating a caterpillar plot to visualize the unsmoothed and smoothed SMRs.
caterpillar_plot <- smr_df %>% arrange(raw_SMR, desc(Exp)) %>% ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(order_id = row_number(),
         raw_CI95up = ifelse(raw_CI95up > 10, 10, raw_CI95up)) %>%
  dplyr::select(!ends_with("_RE")) %>%
  #Pivot longer to help with ggplot
  pivot_longer(cols = raw_SMR:bymmod1_CI95up, 
               names_to = c("SMR_type", ".value"),
               names_sep = "_") %>%
  mutate(SMR_type = ifelse(SMR_type == "bymmod1", "BYM",
                           ifelse(SMR_type == "poissonmod1", "Hierarchical Poisson",
                                  "Raw")))

ggplot(data = caterpillar_plot) +
  geom_point(aes(x = order_id, y = SMR, color = SMR_type, 
                 group = SMR_type), size = 0.2) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(x = order_id, ymin = CI95low, ymax = CI95up, color = SMR_type, 
                 group = SMR_type),
                size=0.2, alpha=0.4) +
  facet_wrap(~SMR_type) +
  ylim(0,10) +
  ylab("Estimated and Crude SMRs") +
  xlab("ZCTA-Racialized Group strata") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank()) +
  labs(color = "SMR Type") +
  ggtitle("Raw and Modeled SMRs for each ZCTA-Racialized Group strata")
  

# ggsave(here("images/09-cook-county-covid/caterpillar_plot_SMRs.png"), width = 9, height = 6)
  
```

```{r image all caterpillar plot}
#| echo = FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("images/09-cook-county-covid/caterpillar_plot_SMRs.png"))
```


The hierarchical models can be most useful when we visualize the estimated ZCTA-specific effects. Since we have racialized group strata within ZCTAs, we can plot maps for each group.

```{r modeled SMR comparison}
#| eval = FALSE,
#| echo = TRUE

# Similar code as for the caterpillar plot above, but we are going to plot just the point estimates on a map, and not the CIs
smr_df %>% 
  arrange(raw_SMR, desc(Exp)) %>% ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(order_id = row_number(),
         raw_CI95up = ifelse(raw_CI95up > 10, 10, raw_CI95up)) %>%
  dplyr::select(!ends_with("_RE")) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = raw_SMR:bymmod1_CI95up, 
               names_to = c("SMR_type", ".value"),
               names_sep = "_") %>%
  left_join(df %>% dplyr::select(geoid, geometry), by="geoid") %>% st_as_sf(sf_column_name = "geometry") %>%
  mutate(SMR_type = ifelse(SMR_type == "bymmod1", "BYM",
                           ifelse(SMR_type == "poissonmod1", "Hierarchical Poisson",
                                  "Raw"))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(fill = SMR)) + 
  geom_sf(size = 0.1) + 
  facet_grid(forcats::fct_rev(race_ethnicity)~SMR_type) + 
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "BrBG",
                       trans = scales::pseudo_log_trans(sigma=0.01),
                       limits = exp(c(-1,1)*log(4)),
                       breaks = c(0.25,0.5,1,2,4), 
                       oob = scales::squish) +
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom',
        legend.text = element_text(angle = 75, hjust=1),
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        panel.grid = element_blank()
        ) +
  ggtitle("Raw and Modeled SMR Maps")

# ggsave(here("images/09-cook-county-covid/modeled_SMR_comparison_1.png"), width = 10, height = 8)
  

```

```{r image modeled SMR comparison}
#| echo = FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here(
  "images/09-cook-county-covid/modeled_SMR_comparison_1.png"))
```

What we see here is that the crude calculated SMRs are very noisy. Using the Poisson hierarchical and BYM models has clear benefits in smoothing the rates. However, there does not seem to be that much difference, at a high level, between the Poisson hierarchical and BYM model. 

The spatial fraction is 72%.

When we look at these smoothed maps, we can see that the risk is lowest for the White non-Hispanic group. However, the spatial patterning of risk is similar for each racialized group. This is because we did not model the spatial component separately for each group. We are going to do this next by fitting a separate models for each racialized group.

```{r racialized group specific models}
#| eval = FALSE,
#| echo = TRUE

## Fitting the models for the White Non-Hispanic group
smr_df_wnh <- smr_df %>% 
  filter(race_ethnicity == "White, non-Hispanic")
#Poisson
formula_poisson_wnh <- Obs ~ 1 + f(geoid, model="iid")

model_poisson_wnh <- inla(formula_poisson_wnh, family="poisson", 
                          data = smr_df_wnh, E=Exp,
                          control.predictor=list(compute=TRUE), 
                          control.compute = list(dic = TRUE), verbose = F)

# As above for the overall models, save the fitted values and CIs

The spatial fraction of the residual variance is 61% for the White, non-Hispanic model; 67.8% for the Black; Hispanic and non-Hispanic model; and 77% for the Hispanic model.

We can visualize the smoothed SMRs from these separate models.

This approach reflects the different spatial patterning of risks for each racialized group, while also smoothing rates. 

We may also be interested in looking at the area-specific **residuals**. These give us a sense of how much each areas risk deviates from the county-wide mean, conditional on any covariates we include in the model. We can visualize the residuals of the models above (where no covariates were included)

```{r BYM residuals plot}
#| eval = FALSE,
#| echo = TRUE

smr_df %>% 
  arrange(raw_SMR, desc(Exp)) %>% ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(order_id = row_number(),

  pivot_longer(cols = c(poissonmodspecific_RE:bymmodspecific_RE), 
               names_to = c("RE_type", ".value"),
               names_sep = "_") %>%
  left_join(df %>% dplyr::select(geoid, geometry), by="geoid") %>% st_as_sf(sf_column_name = "geometry") %>%
  mutate(SMR_type = recode(RE_type,
                           bymmodspecific = "BYM", 
                           poissonmodspecific = "Hierarchical Poisson")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(fill = RE)) +

                       trans = scales::pseudo_log_trans(sigma=0.01),
                       limits = exp(c(-1,1)*log(4)),
                       breaks = c(0.25,0.5,1,2,4), 
                       oob = scales::squish) +
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(legend.position = 'right', 
        panel.grid = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank()
        ) +
  labs(fill = "Residual SMR") +
  ggtitle("ZCTA-specific model residuals", subtitle = "Each Racialized Group Modeled Separately") 

# ggsave(here("images/09-cook-county-covid/model_residuals_race_specific.png"), width = 9, height = 8)
```


```{r image BYM residuals}
#| echo = FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here(
  "images/09-cook-county-covid/model_residuals_race_specific.png"))
```

Finally, as in the non-hierarchical models above, we can also add ABSMs to these hierarchical models. The model would be as follows:

$$
log(\theta_{ij}) = \beta_0 + \mathbf{\beta}(ABSM_i) + u_i + v_i \\
where \ v_i \sim Normal(0,\sigma^2_v) \ ,\  and \\
u_i \sim Conditional \ Autoregressive(W, \sigma_u^2)
$$


Let us fit this model, using only the ICE for racialized economic segregation as the ABSM of interest:
