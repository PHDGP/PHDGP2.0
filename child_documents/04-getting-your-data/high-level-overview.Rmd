## High Level Overview

For the application of mapping area health outcome rates, georeferenced data are
made up of three components: health outcome counts, population estimates, and
the geographic boundaries of the areal units of interest. Each of these data may
each come from different data sources, but they are linked together in practice
by merging the data together by geographic area identifiers.

Some examples of area identifiers common in the United States context include
codes for ZIP codes, county FIPS codes, census block or census tract IDs, etc.
As shown in Figure \@ref(fig:censusGeographicHierarchy) (below), there are two
major sets of geographies employed by the US Census Bureau. The first concerns
fundamental administrative and political units (referred to as the “spine” of US
Census geography) which are relevant to the primary rationale of the US census
to allocate political representation (Krieger 2019); these areas include census
block, block-groups, tracts, counties, and states, and corresponding units for
American Indian, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian areas, with the census block
being the core area used to create voting districts (at the local, state, and
federal levels). The second set includes an array of additional areas, which
often cross the boundaries of these core Census geographic areas, such as ZIP
Codes, school districts, traffic analysis zones, etc.

If you are studying area level health outcome rates, you may find that you must
source these different necessary pieces from different places. Population
estimates can often come from the Census or its related data products, health
outcomes may come from healthcare providers, public health departments,
electronic health records (EHR), or other sources, and geography shapefiles are
similarly available from numerous sources including the Census.
