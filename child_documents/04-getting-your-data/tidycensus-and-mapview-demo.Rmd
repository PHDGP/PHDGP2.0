## tidycensus

For some databases, R programmers have already written packages to help users
submit their queries and get back their data of interest.  One such example
is the U.S. Census, for which the `tidycensus` package exists to automate
fetching Census data in R.

The `tidycensus` package in R allows you to download data from the US Census
Bureau products, including from the decennial Census and the 1-year, 3-year, and
5-year American Community Survey (ACS). Find detailed reference materials and 
an introduction to `tidycensus` here: https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/ 

In this section, we will walk you through example code that downloads the
percent of residents under the poverty line and computing the Index of
Concentration at the Extremes (ICE) for racialized economic segregation from the
2015-2019 ACS. As an example, we will demonstrate how to download these measures
at the census tract level in Suffolk County, Massachusetts noting that this
county includes the city of Boston, where the PHDGP 2.0 training team members
are based!

You can find more of the variables available in the 5-year ACS at the following
link, changing 2019 to your desired year starting with 2009
when the ACS began: https://api.census.gov/data/2019/acs/acs5/variables.html 

```{r geoid_structure}
#| echo = FALSE,
#| center = TRUE,
#| fig.cap = 'The structure of Census tract GEOIDs'

```{r censusGeographicHierarchy}

```

Here's example code for downloading data on the percent of people living 
in households with household income less than the poverty threshold. 
The poverty thresholds are defined by the US Census 
(see: https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/poverty/guidance/poverty-measures.html).

We can also use the `mapview` package to render interactive maps of the estimates and data we have computed/downloaded. This is particularly helpful in understanding how the geography relate to the estimates â€” especially to see where airports, green-space, schools, and other municipal zones may be located and which are not zoned to include residential units (hence the NaN or "not a number" estimates shown on the maps), but which may nevertheless be locations where unsheltered and other unhoused persons reside.

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE
# read cached data
poverty <- readRDS(here('data/04-getting-your-data/poverty_suffolk_county.rds'))
```

```{r}
library(mapview)
mapview::mapview(poverty, zcol = 'percent_in_poverty')
```

For reference, these are the poverty thresholds in US dollars for 2017 (i.e. the
middle year of the 2015-2019 time-period) from the Census:

```{r povertyThresholds}
#| echo = FALSE
# knitr::include_graphics(here("images/04-getting-your-data/2017_poverty_thresholds.png"))
htmltools::includeHTML(here("data/04-getting-your-data/thresh17.htm"))
```


Now that we've created static and interactive maps of the poverty estimates for
Suffolk County, we can move on to downloading and computing the Index of
Concentration at the Extremes for Racialized Economic Segregation (High Income
White non-Hispanic High Income vs. Low Income People of Color).

# create a data dictionary detailing the variables we're going to use -

# description can help make the subsequent code more readable and thus easier
# to debug in case you run into any errors.
